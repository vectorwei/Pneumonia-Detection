# Pneumonia-Detection
• Applied traditional machine learning methods, such as KNN, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and SVM, to classify chest X-rays and evaluated results; addressed imbalanced data with SMOTE and Tomek links.<br>
• Employed CNN to improve pneumonia detection accuracy in chest X-rays.<br>
• Leveraged Mask-RCNN to identify and localize pneumonia-affected lung areas, evaluating the model’s performance.<br>
